                            <p style="text-align:justify;">As a small business owner you have more important things to do than to keep your own books. We take care of your books for you, so you can get back to the job of running your business and generating profits.

</p>
                            <p style="text-align:justify;">Each month or quarter we’ll do the following things for you…</p>
                            <ul class="list1-1">
                                <li>Reconcile your bank account</li>
                                <li>Generate an income statement</li>
                                <li>Generate a balance sheet</li>
                                <li>Clean up your general ledger</li>
                                <li>Provide unlimited consultations</li>
                                
                                
                            </ul>
                            <p style="text-align:justify;">These tasks form the solid foundation of your small business accounting system. You can customize the package of services you receive by adding payroll, tax planning, tax preparation, or any of our other services.</p>
                            <h3>Bank Reconciliation</h3>
                          <p style="text-align:justify;">
Reconciling your business checking account each month allow us to keep your bank account, accounting, and taxes up-to-date.
Having us reconcile your account each month allows you to…<br>
Identify lost checks, lost deposits and unauthorized wire transactions.
Detect and prevent excess/unjustified bank charges and ensures transactions are posted correctly by your bank.
Detect and prevent embezzlement of funds from within your company.<br>
<br>
Know how your business is doing? You can’t really know unless all accounts are reconciled and properly accounted for on your financial statement.
Manage your cash more effectively. Proper management of funds not only saves money, it makes money for you.
Protect yourself. By timely reconciling and promptly objecting to your bank about any unauthorized, fraudulent or forged checks presented to your bank and paid by that bank, you can relieve your agency of responsibility for the shortfall and transfer the risk to the bank. This reason to reconcile alone should be enough. Crime exists.<br>
<br>

Sleep Better. You will sleep more peacefully at night knowing your bank accounts are reconciled, in balance and that all escrow funds, accounts, checks and disbursed funds are properly accounted for.</p>


<h3>Income Statement</h3>
                          <p style="text-align:justify;">An income statement, otherwise known as a profit and loss statement, basically adds an itemized list of all your revenues and subtracts an itemized list of all your expenses to come up with a profit or loss for the period.<br>
<br>

An income statement allows you to…<br>
<br>
Track revenues and expenses so that you can determine the operating performance of your business. 
Determine what areas of your business are over-budget or under-budget. 
Identify specific items that are causing unexpected expenditures. Like phone, fax, mail, or supply expenses.
Track dramatic increases in product returns or cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales.<br>
Determine your income tax liability.</p>

<h3>Balance Sheet</h3>
                          <p style="text-align:justify;">
A balance sheet gives you a snapshot of your business’ financial condition at a specific moment in time.<br>
<br>
A balance sheet helps you…<br>
<br>
Quickly get a handle on the financial strength and capabilities of your business.
Identify and analyze trends, particularly in the area of receivables and payables. For example, if your receivables cycle is lengthening, maybe you can collect your receivables more aggressively. <br>
Determine if your business is in a position to expand.
Determine if your business can easily handle the normal financial ebbs and flows of revenues and expenses?<br>
Determine if you need to take immediate steps to bolster cash reserves?<br>
Determine if your business has been slowing down payables to forestall an inevitable cash shortage?<br>
<br>
Balance sheets, along with income statements, are the most basic elements in providing financial reporting to potential lenders such as banks, investors, and vendors who are considering how much credit to grant you.</p>

<h3>Maintaining a Clean General Ledger</h3>
                          <p style="text-align:justify;">The general ledger is the core of your company’s financial records. These records constitute the central “books” of your system. Since every transaction flows through the general ledger, a problem with your general ledger throws off all your books.<br>
<br>
Having us review your general ledger system each month allows us to hunt down any discrepancies such as double billings or any unrecorded payments. Then we’ll fix the discrepancies so your books are always accurate and kept in tip top shape.</p>

<h3>Unlimited Consultations</h3>
                          <p style="text-align:justify;">We are always available to spend time with you so you fully understand how to interpret and utilize the financial information we provide. Our consultations are already included in our price, so please feel free to call us whenever you have a question or concern.</p>

        <h4 class="modal-title">Audits – Reviews – Compilations</h4>
      </div>
      <div class="modal-body">
          <h2>AUDIT – HIGHEST LEVEL OF ASSURANCE</h2>
          <p>An audit provides the highest level of assurance. An audit is a methodical review and objective examination of the financial statements, including the verification of specific information as determined by the auditor or as established by general practice.</p>
          <p>Our work includes a review of internal controls, testing of selected transactions, and communication with third parties. Based on our findings, we issue a report on whether the financial statements are fairly stated and free of material misstatements.</p>
              
          <h2>An Audit allows you to…</h2>
          <p>Satisfy stakeholders such as employees, customers, suppliers and pressure groups, as well as the investing community, as to the credibility of published information.</p>
          <p>Facilitate the payment of corporate tax, goods and services tax, and other taxes on-time and accurately, thereby avoiding interest, penalties, and investigations.</p>
          <p>Comply with banking covenants.</p>
          <p>Help deter and detect material fraud and error.</p>
          <p>Facilitate the purchase and sale of businesses.</p>
          <p>Here’s what you get…</p>
          <p>You get the highest level of assurance because we go outside your company to obtain more information. Typically, we’ll have written communication with:</p>
          <p>Your customers, to check outstanding receivable balances,<br>
              Your banks, to confirm cash or debt balances and terms,<br>
              Your vendors, to verify outstanding payable balances, and<br>
              Your attorneys, for information on pending or threatened legal action.</p>
          <p>We also perform physical inspections by observing your inventory counting methods and perform test counts. We document and test each operating cycle, including sales and cash receipts, expenses and cash disbursements, and payroll. Our audit papers include a detailed work program to document the examinations and testing performed, as well as the client’s supporting work papers.</p>
          <h2>Audits Not Just for Public Entities</h2>
          <p>All public companies are required to have an annual audit, but some nonpublic entities must undergo an annual audit as well. These include local governments, not-for-profit agencies and other organizations receiving government grants.</p>
          <p>Moreover, some financial institutions require audits of nonpublic companies based on the financing amount and/or the bank’s assessment of the company’s risk. Also, companies with absentee ownership (such as those owned by investment firms, or individuals who no longer run the business) may order audits as checks of their management teams.</p>
          <h2>REVIEW – LIMITED ASSURANCE</h2>
          <p>Less extensive than an audit, but more involved than a compilation, a review engagement consists primarily of analytical procedures we apply to the financial statements, and various inquiries we make of your company’s management team. If the financial statements or supporting information appear inconsistent or otherwise questionable, we may need to perform additional procedures.</p>    
          <p>A review doesn’t require us to study and evaluate your company’s internal controls or verify data with third parties or physically inspect assets. Rather, a review report expresses limited assurance in the form of the statement: “We are not aware of any material modifications” for the financial statements to be in conformity with the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Reviewed financial statements must include all required footnotes and other disclosures.</p>
          <p>Why might a business request a review engagement? It can be a good middle ground, providing the advantages of a CPA’s technical expertise without the work and expense of an audit.</p>
          <h2>COMPILATION – LOWEST LEVEL OF ASSURANCE</h2>
          <p>In compiling financial statements for a client, we present information that is the “representation of management” and expresses no opinion or assurance on the statements. Compilations don’t require inquiries of management or analytical procedures. Instead, we rely on our knowledge of accounting principles and a general understanding of your business.</p>
          <p>Banks often require compilations from an independent CPA as part of their lending covenants.</p>
          
          <h2>Which Report Should You Use?</h2>
          <p>Each type of financial statement report may suit specific circumstances, depending on requirements from your client’s bank or other parties, as well as meet budgetary needs.</p>
          <p>Understanding each report’s unique strengths and weaknesses can help you choose the most appropriate one. Please call if you have questions about which type of report is right for you.</p>

          <ul class="list1-1">
              <li>grow and preserve assets by keeping Uncle Sam out of your pockets.</li>
              <li>defer income so you can keep your money now and pay less taxes later.</li>
              <li>reduce taxes on your income so you keep more of what you make.</li>
              <li>reduce taxes on your estate so your family keeps more of what you’ve made.</li>

          </ul>              
          <p>Here’s just a few of the Tax Saving Strategies we use…</p>
          <p>Splitting income among several family members or legal entities in order to get more of the income taxed in lower bracket.</p>
          <p>Shifting income or expenses from one year to another in order to have them fall where it will be taxed at a lower rate.</p>
          <p>Deferring tax liabilities through certain investment choices such as pension plans, contributions and other similar plans.</p>
          <p>Using certain investments to produce income that is tax exempt from either federal or state or both taxing entities.</p>
          <p>Finding tax deductions by structuring your money to pay for things you enjoy, such as a vacation home.</p>
          <p>Remember, we work for you not for the IRS. Many of our clients save many times the fee in reduced tax liability through careful planning and legitimate tax strategies.</p>
