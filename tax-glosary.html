                    <h3>Filing statuses</h3>
                    <p>Five taxpayer categories that determine the amount of tax and/or tax credits that apply to different taxpayers. The five filing statuses are (from lowest to highest tax): Married Filing Jointly; Qualifying Widow(er) with Dependent Child; Head of Household; Single; Married Filing Separately.</p>
                    <h3>First-time Homebuyer Credit</h3>
                    <p>The first-time homebuyer credit is a maximum of $8,000 ($4,000 for Married Filing Separately). This is a refundable credit which means that even if the taxpayer does not owe any tax, the money will be refunded to the taxpayer. There are payback provisions if the home was sold within a 36 month period.</p>
                    <h3>Five-Year Test Period Suspension</h3>
                    <p>Taxpayers can choose to have the five-year test period for ownership and use suspended during any period the homeowner (either spouse if married) served on qualified official extended duty as a member of the uniformed services or Foreign Service of the United States, as an employee of the intelligence community, or as an employee or volunteer of the Peace Corps. This means that the taxpayer may be able to meet the two-year use test even if the taxpayer and/or spouse did not actually live in the home during the normal five-year period required of other taxpayers.</p>
                    <h3>Foreign Earned Income Exclusion</h3>
                    <p>The foreign earned income exclusion allows eligible taxpayers to avoid paying federal income tax on their foreign earned income.</p>
