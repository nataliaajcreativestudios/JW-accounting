                            <p style="text-align:justify;">When it comes to paying employees, State Labor laws and the IRS have made the payroll function a time consuming nightmare for the small business owner.<br>
<br>


Small business owners spend an average of eight hours a month performing payroll functions. That’s 12 full days a year that could be spent generating sales, prospecting new business opportunities, improving products or services, or servicing customers.<br>

We offer payroll solutions that meet your business’s needs and enable you to spend time doing what you do best–running your company.
